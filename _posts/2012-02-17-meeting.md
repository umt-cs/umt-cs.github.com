We are meeting at **5 PM this Friday (02-17)** in SS 362. We will have a
workshop/help session for the first portion of the meeting (up to 30 min.),
followed by a presentation by Craig Messerman from Sentinel High. Craig will
talk about a possible project involving an earth science unit they are
studying and possible development of an app with disaster and earth science
information as a final product. _Thanks to Josh Austin for setting this up!_

Stephanie will be bringing Mardi Gras food too!
