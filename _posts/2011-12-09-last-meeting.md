We'll be meeting for the last time this semester, **Friday (Dec. 9)** at 5:30 PM
in Social Sciences 362. It'll be a series of small lectures (2-5 min) followed
by some planning for next semester:

- iOS development by Josh Austin
- Windows phone development by Nick Busby
- Ruby by Jon-Michael Deldin
- TeX by Clinton McKay
- Flex development by Craig McNinch

See you then!
